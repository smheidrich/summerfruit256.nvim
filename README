This is a fork of https://github.com/vim-scripts/summerfruit256.vim to make it
work in recent (as of 2025, i.e. 0.10+) versions of Neovim.

So far, this is done by just restoring the original Vim color definitions as
recommended in the `:help colorscheme` docs.

NOTE that if the colors look a bit more desaturated than you're used to from
Vim or older versions of Neovim, you may also need to `:set notermguicolors`,
because they changed something related to that as well (too lazy to figure out
exactly what & don't care).

There are some minor remaining differences (e.g. visual selections don't retain
syntax highlighting for the text color), but it's good enough for me.

88/256 color version of Armin Ronacher's summerfruit color scheme (vimscript #1872).  Used Henry So Jr.'s color approximation (vimscript #1243) for the color conversion.
